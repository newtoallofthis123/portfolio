            My site had a lot of stuff once upon a time. I've moved most of it
            to <Link href="https://nutils.vercel.app">nutils</Link>, which is
            like the interface through which I interact with my central
            database. This site is more about my thoughts and ideas now.
            However, it still redirects to the old stuff, so you can still
            access it. These are hence, all the things I've made, and the things
            I've written that you can actively interact with.

                is as cool as you. Check out the <a

                    href="https://github.com/newtoallofthis123/nshrt">cli</a
                > as well.

            <li>
                <Link href="/nutils">NoobPaste</Link>: Pastebin, as old as time
                itself. Check out the <a

                written over time.

                And that's pretty much it. I have a lot of other stuff that I've
                made, but it's not really worth mentioning here.
