                            Hi! I am a Ishan and I am a 19 year old self taught
                            developer from India. You can know more about me
                            from my <a href="/about">About</a> section. Anyways,
                            putting all of that aside, welcome to my blog, Ishan
                            Writes. Well, I know the name is quite simple, but I
                            love simplicity. The site design itself is inspired by
                            <a href="https://www.nytimes.com">NYTimes</a>, one
                            of the best designs I have ever seen. I mean, it is
                            a fusion. I always wanted a blog, one I made on my
                            own, so here it is. The blog itself is written in <a
                                href="https://astro.build">Astro</a
                            > and uses <a href="https://tailwindcss.com"
                                >TailwindCSS</a
                            > for styling.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This blog is a subsidiary of my main site and is
                            hosted on <a href="https://vercel.com">Vercel</a>.
                            You can expect the writing style to be simple and
                            casual. I am not a professional writer, so I will
                            write as I speak. You can also expect a lot terms
                            and phrases from the programming world and the GenZ
                            world. I will try to keep the posts as short as
                            possible, but I will not compromise on the content.
                            Blogging has always been a favourite of mine.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This blog will mostly have technical posts, but I
                            will also write about my life and my experiences.
                            So, stay tuned for that. I will also try to post as
                            frequently as possible, but I am a student, so I
                            cannot promise anything :)

                        <p>
                            Well, I thought I should make this clear, just in
                            case. All the content written in this blog is my own
                            opinion and does not reflect the opinion of any
                            other person or organization. Some of these might
                            not be based in cold hard facts, but they are my
                            opinions and I am sorry if I hurt your feelings. In
                            the end, I am just a 19 year old kid, so please
                            don't take my opinions too seriously. I started
                            programming quite recently, so, if you think I did
                            something wrong, please let me know. One more thing,
                            I am not a native English speaker, so please excuse
                            any grammatical errors you might find. Moreover, I
                            might use some terms and phrases from the
                            programming world and the GenZ world, so please
                            excuse that as well.
