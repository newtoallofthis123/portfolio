        Back to college and stuff is going on pretty well.
        I am trying to fit gym into my schedule and it's been pretty good.
        My body's slowly getting used to the routine.
        It's been pretty hard to do open source stuff, job and gym all at once,
        but it's keeping me busy and I am enjoying it.

        I also started a small attention management system for myself.
        I am slowly getting back control of my attention and I am able to focus on things better.
        Like for example, I am going on walks without music and trying to work in silence and it's been pretty good.
