There is a saying in my native tongue, which I will try my best to convert to english, but unfornutanetly it doesn't sound as good: "Small mouth, big words".
This expression is used to describe a situation where someone young, talks like an adult or out of his league.
I am sure that this post will sound like that, but I would like foward some stuff that I think about this to you. So keep in mind that I am only 19, take my words with a grain of salt and let me get started.
