So since the goal is to be able to run the thread in the userspace, and even if we do end
up with a dynamic privilege escalation model, at some point we would need our program to do the following:

"Parse the UID of a loginable user from a process in root."

Now this might sound easy at first, just use the `getuid()` syscall and you're done.
However, that is not the case. The `getuid()` syscall returns the real user ID of the calling process.
So when we actually use `sudo ./program`, the `getuid()` syscall will return the UID of the root ie 0.

The way to actually get the UID hence became quite a bit more complicated.
So with the help of my [references](#references), I was able to come up with the following approachs and the one I ended up using.

### Approach 1: The SUDO_UID Environment Variable

It turns out that when a program is run through sudo, the `SUDO_UID` environment variable is set to the UID of the user who ran the program.
This might be very useful for our use case, as we can just read the environment variable and get the UID.

```rust
use std::env;

fn get_uid() -> u32 {
    let uid = env::var("SUDO_UID").unwrap();
    uid.parse::<u32>().unwrap()
}
```

As simple as that, we can now get the UID of the user who ran the program.
However, there are quite a few problems with this approach.
The first and the most obvious being that `sudo` is not there on every system.
Moreover, the program need not be run through `sudo` always, so this approach is not very reliable.

This drawback is enough to discard this approach, and hence I moved on to the next one.

### Approach 2: The /proc/PID/status File

The `/proc/PID/status` file contains a lot of information about the process with the given PID.
One of the fields in this file is the `Uid` field, which contains the real, effective, and saved UIDs of the process.

Specially the `Uid` field looks like this:

```
Uid:    1000    0    0    0
```

The above would be true for any program run through a sudo like process.
Moreover, there is also the `/proc/PID/loginuid` file which contains the UID of the user who logged in.

```rust
use std::fs;

fn get_uid(pid: u32) -> u32 {
    let login_uid = fs::read_to_string("/proc/".to_string() + &pid.to_string() + "/loginuid").unwrap();
    login_uid.trim().parse::<u32>().unwrap()
}
```

This approach is much more reliable than the previous one and also depends on the program and the generallized
linux system.
However, the next one sounds equally promising.

### Approach 3: The /etc/passwd File

The `/etc/passwd` file contains a lot of information about the users on the system.
One of the fields in this file is the UID of all of the users.

From my research I was able to find that the UID of a user who is not root and is loginable is always greater than 1000.
This is true for almost all of the linux systems, and hence we can use this information to get the UID of the user.

```rust
use std::fs;

fn get_uid() -> u32 {
    let passwd = fs::read_to_string("/etc/passwd").unwrap();
    let lines: Vec<&str> = passwd.split("\n").collect();
    for line in lines {
        let parts: Vec<&str> = line.split(":").collect();
        if parts[2].parse::<u32>().unwrap() > 1000 {
            return parts[2].parse::<u32>().unwrap();
        }
    }
    0
}
```

This approach seems to be the most recommended one, as it is the most reliable and also the most general.

## /proc vs /etc/passwd

The `/proc/PID/status` file is a file that is created for every process that is run on the system.
This means that this method is inherently dynamic.
Now to be fair, if we parse it like this, we are almost guaranteed to get the UID of the user who ran the program.
Plus since the `/proc` directory is used by the linux kernel itself, it is very unlikely that this system
behaviour would be changed.

On the other hand, the `/etc/passwd` file is a file that is created by the linux system itself and
it is updated only whenever the login information of a user is changed.
This means that this method is inherently static.
The `/etc/passwd` file is hence also a good method.

However, a small problem come in the UID itself.
We are only assuming that the UID of a loginable user is always greater than 1000.
This assumption is tue for *most* of the linux systems, but not all of them.
However, the same is true if the tables turn.
What if the user who is running the program is not a loginable user?

Well all of these are the questions that I am still trying to answer.

## Conclusion

After looking at all of the approaches, I decided to go with the `/etc/passwd` file approach.
This is because it seems to be the most generally used approach.
Hence SWHKD can just read the /etc/passwd file and get the UID of the user who ran the program.

However, I am going to stash the `/proc/PID/status` just in case the `/etc/passwd` file approach fails.

One more interesting approach can be that if I do not find the UID of users who are greater than 1000 in the `/etc/passwd` file,
I can fallback to the `/proc/PID/status` file approach.

Hence, the program can look something like this:

```rust
fn parse_uid_from_line(line: &str) -> u32 {
    line.split(':').nth(2).unwrap().parse::<u32>().unwrap()
}

fn parse_from_login() -> Result<u32, std::num::ParseIntError> {
    let pid = std::process::id();
    let status_path = format!("/proc/{}/loginuid", pid);
    let status = fs::read_to_string(status_path).expect("Unable to read /proc/<pid>/loginuid");
    status.trim().parse::<u32>()
}

fn get_uid() -> Result<u32, Box<dyn Error>> {
    let pwd_content = fs::read_to_string("/etc/passwd").expect("Unable to read /etc/passwd");

    let pwd_lines = pwd_content.lines().collect::<Vec<_>>();
    match pwd_lines
        .iter()
        .find(|line| !line.contains("nologin") && parse_uid_from_line(line) >= 1000)
    {
        Some(line) => Ok(parse_uid_from_line(line)),
        None => match parse_from_login() {
            Ok(uid) => Ok(uid),
            Err(e) => Err(Box::new(e)),
        },
    }
}
```

This ensures that the program is able to get the UID of the user who ran the program in almost all of the cases.
Hopefully this will work out.
