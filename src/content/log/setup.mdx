To setup, you first need to have rust installed on your system.
Then, clone the repo: [waycate/swhkd](https://github.com/waycrate/swhkd) and run the commands below.
This will generate two binaries in the target/release folder. One's the server daemon and other's
the actual SWHKD client.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/waycrate/swhkd && cd swhkd
cargo build --release && cd target/release
./swhks && pkexec ./swhkd --config ~/.config/swhkd/swkhdrc
```

I originally planned on installing a nice wayland based window manager and 
using SWHKD on it, however, I use Ubuntu 24.04 as my daily driver and most
wayland based window managers seem to not work well on it.

So, most of the testing will be done on my ubuntu-gnome, which I find kinda cool and
funny.
However, if you are interested in actually using swhkd to it's full extent, I would
recommend you use a window manager like sway or hyprland if you use Arch btw.
