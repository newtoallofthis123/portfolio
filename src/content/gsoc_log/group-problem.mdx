So as I mentioned in my [last post](/gsoc/logs/set-env) about setting up the environment, I had to
rethink the way I was doing the env, using an IPC approach to only get the `env` and essentially
emulate it in the child process that was being launched from the thread.
However, this was still causing a very major bug, that was discovered when I was trying to run
the `sudo apt update` command on a terminal that was spawned from the thread and I got the error:

```bash
sudo: cannot read the sudoes file
``` 

This was a very major issue, which meant that appropriate permissions were not being set for the
child process. So, with the recommendation of my mentor, I decided to make a small diff
of a process that would be launched normally (from dmenu) and one that would be launched from the
thread. This was to see if there was any difference in the proc tree and the permissions that were
being set. 
Turns out, there was a *major* difference: The `groups` that were being set for the child process
were not at all the same and rather with sufficient permissions then then one that was being launched
normally. 
These were checked in the `/proc/<pid>/status` file, where the `Groups` field was being checked.
This was done in rust, but can be emulated using `sh` as well:
```bash
cat /proc/23190/status | grep Groups
```

==Output==
```bash
# Normal 
Groups:	4 6 24 27 30 46 100 114 129 993 995 1000 64055
# Our Thread
Groups:	1000
```

So this boils down our problems to the `groups` that were being set for the child process.
I think this can be solved using the `setgroups` syscall, which is used to set the groups for the
child process. This is what I will be working on next, and hopefully, this will solve the issue
that we are facing.
