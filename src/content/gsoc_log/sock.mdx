For the sake of clarity before hand, this post should be considered only an experiment.
However, it does seem to be quite viable, although I'm not sure if it's the best way to do it.

So as I had mentioned in my previous log, it would be kinda cool and easy if we just use the already exisiting
client server architecture and treat the server almost like a utility program that is always running in the background.

The reason for so many issues and CVE's with the client server architecture was because the server was actually running 
a shell commmand, ie the `sh -c` which essentially gave full access by text input to any possible adversary.
Now this would not have been a problem if not for the IPC as well, which essentially created a bridge between the server and the client.
A bridge that can be went under, over, or even through (bad analogy, but you get the point).

So, I thought, since the env is now a problem both from a UX standpoint as well as the only issue with the ITC stuff going
on in the main binary, why not just use a socket to send the env to the client, and then the client can parse it as it's own
env and run the commands.
This way, the server is just a utility program that is always running in the background, and the client is the one that
actually responsible for the actual stuff.

In fact, it can even be possible that the server be immediately terminated or made into a zombie process once the client
has received the env.
This would ensure improved security and also a better UX, as the client can now be run as a standalone program, and the server
was just a startup utility.

The code part of this would be quite simple as well:

**Server**
```rust
let listener = UnixListener::bind(sock_file_path)?;
for stream in listener.incoming() {
    match stream {
        Ok(stream) => {
            log::info!("New client!");
            handle_client(stream, &environment)?;
        }
        Err(e) => {
            log::error!("Error accepting connection: {:?}", e);
            break;
        }
    }
}
fn handle_client(mut socket: UnixStream, environment: &environ::Env)
    -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let env = environment.to_string();

    socket.write_all(env.as_bytes())?;
    socket.flush()?;

    Ok(())
}
```

**Client**
```rust
fn socket_read(socket_path: PathBuf) -> Result<String, Box<dyn Error>> {
    let mut stream = UnixStream::connect(socket_path)?;
    let mut response = String::new();
    stream.read_to_string(&mut response)?;
    Ok(response)
}
let env = socket_read(sock_file_path)?;
let env = environ::Env::from_str(&env);
```

As simple as that.
All of the heavy weight lifting regarding the parsing and setting of the env can 
be the concern of the new-ly introduced environ module.

Thus, this offers quite a good solution to the problem at hand, and also makes the
current server be of some use instead of just phasing it out.
