So now that we have the env from the server and our system seems to work quite well, the next step would be to focus much more on usability
and improving the UX of the project.
Since trying to condense the server into the daemon was not really possible, we still able to reduce the importance of the server.
Now it's only functionality is broadcasting the env of the userspace where it is running into the socket so that it can be picked up by the
priveledged daemon.

One idea of make sure that we always have the latest env and keep up with any changes that the user makes, we could daemonize the server, 
making it run in the background, ready for the daemon to request the env whenever it requires it.
This was pretty simple to do with the `nix` crate.

```rust
let _ = daemon(true, false);
```

However, the tricky part was to figure out when the daemon would need an env refreh anyways.
So, we came up with an idea of a cron like job in the event loop, which would have a non blocking counter counting in seconds.
This can be configured by the user through a flag called `--refresh`.

```bash
./swhks && doas ./swhkd -r 30
```

This would mean that it would refresh the env every 30 seconds and depending on your use case, you may probably set this up in a higher value:
In minutes, probably 5.
The actual process of refreshing the env is pretty non resource intensive, the overall memory and CPU increase while refreshing is pretty negligible
(+4MB, +0.5%).

The actual way to refresh the env is too quite simple:

```rust
_ = &mut next_env, if sock_mutex => {
    log::info!("Refreshing Env");
    env = refresh_env(&uname, invoking_uid).unwrap();
    next_env.as_mut().reset(Instant::now() + Duration::from_secs(server_cooldown));
}
```

The `refresh_env` is the new abstraction function introduced to deal with filling in the env from the server.
The actual process of getting the env from the server is blocking, however, it only tries about 5-6 times before actually quitting the daemon with an error.

I am next looking into trying to use `notify-send` to better improve the user experience.
