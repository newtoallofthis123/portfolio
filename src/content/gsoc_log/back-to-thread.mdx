So the problem with the su approach was that when I was trying to run
`swhkd` as a setuid binary, it's owner was root. This meant that su would recognize
any commands being executed by `swhkd` as root, and not the user.
Hence, when we actually want to de-escalate the privileges of the child process,
it asks us for the user's password, which is less than ideal for a hotkey daemon.

Hence, after trying for a really long time, I decided to switch to a different approach.
When I was last using threads to execute the commands, we had decided to not use it because
of the `env` problem. However, now that we have a solution to the `env`, we can use de-escalated
threads to run the commands again.

This essentially works as follows:

```rust
tokio::spawn(async move {
    setgid(Gid::from_raw(user_id)).unwrap();
    setuid(Uid::from_raw(user_id)).unwrap();

    let mut cmd = Command::new("sh");
    cmd.arg("-c").arg(command).stdin(Stdio::null());
    for (key, value) in pairs {
        cmd.env(key, value);
    }

    match cmd.spawn() {
        Ok(_) => log::info!("Command executed successfully."),
        Err(e) => log::error!("Failed to execute command: {}", e),
    }
});
```

This was designed to spawn a new thread for each command that we want to execute.
However, this we are creating a new thread for each command, which is not ideal.
We can instead use a single thread that is valid throughout the lifetime of the daemon and we can communicate with it using a channel.
It would look something like this:

```rust
let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel::<String>();

tokio::spawn(async move {
    while let Some(command) = rx.recv().await {
        setgid(Gid::from_raw(user_id)).unwrap();
        setuid(Uid::from_raw(user_id)).unwrap();

        let mut cmd = Command::new("sh");
        cmd.arg("-c").arg(command).stdin(Stdio::null());
        for (key, value) in pairs {
            cmd.env(key, value);
        }

        match cmd.spawn() {
            Ok(_) => log::info!("Command executed successfully."),
            Err(e) => log::error!("Failed to execute command: {}", e),
        }
    }
});

// In the main thread
tx.send(command).await.unwrap();
```

This way, we can send commands to the thread and it will execute them with the user's privileges.
Moreover, this also works well with the setuid binary, as the thread is running with the user's privileges and doesn't
need to ask for the user's password.
