The su implementation is almost ready, but I am still working on it.
However, a new idea came to my mind, one which is highly experimental, yet has a very good chance of 
actually working and behave as expected in the future.

So, the main problem that was encountered in the previous security model was the fact that the 
child process was essentially a open honey pot for man in the middle attacks.
Essentially speaking, since we were using a socket to communicate between a priveleged parent and 
an unpriveleged child, if someone was able to connect to the socket, they could pass in any weird stuff
to the child process. Now the problem is that the child process was essentially open access to the
`sh -c` command.
The child process was, in a humanized sense, not *thinking*, it was just a shell.

Well the first thought would be to run the parent itself as a unpriveleged user and this would be a
good idea. However, it's not quite as simple as that.
The parent process is the one that is responsible for actually catching and detecting the keystrokes.
Without it running as a root process, it would not be able to catch the keystrokes.
The parent, once it catches the keystrokes, processes it and sends it to the child.
By processes it, I mean reads keystrokes and maps it to a command using the config parser.

So, why don't we let it do what it would do best: read keystrokes.
This Approach aims to shift the responsibility of the parent to the child.

Common Security Knowledge dictates that the safest way to execute a command is to generate the command in the
same process that is going to execute it, however, we would need the keystrokes to be able to determine 
what the command is in the first place.

So, in this model, both the server and the client would exist, communicating with each other through a socket file.
The client (root process) would be responsible for catching the keystrokes and packaging them into a commonly 
understandable format; a simple deserializeable struct, json or even just a string.
The server would then recieve the keystrokes, process them within itself.
So the command mapping as a whole is happening within the server itself, the same place where we are executing the
command too.

This would mean that the server would be responsible for mapping the command, and the client would be responsible
for providing the necessary keystrokes data to the server.
So this would mean that instead of just being a glorified shell mapper, the server would be the one that actually
maps the command and executes it.

This would have the following benefits:
1. No more weird env stuff or any root to user mapping shenanigans.
2. Commands are never sent over the network.
3. The server and client both specialize in their own tasks.
4. Reduced risk of man in the middle attacks.
5. Simpler to maintain.
6. Too much new code will not be introduced either, just existing code will be repurposed in the server.


This is a highly experimental approach and I am not sure if it would work, but it's worth a shot.
If this works, it would essentially solve our security model problem in a very easy to implement way.

I will however, still be working on the `su` approach till I get this approved, however, it might be a good
solution.
