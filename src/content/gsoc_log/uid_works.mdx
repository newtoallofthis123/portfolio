After discussing the [previous approach](/gsoc/logs/uid),
I realized that the `/proc/self/loginuid` would be a viable option to get the UID of the user who ran the program. 
However, this was initially thought to be as `/proc/self/status` which contains the UIDs of the process, which looks
like this:

```
Uid:    1000    0    0    0
```

This should work technically, however, when I run it from the rust program, it seems wrong.

```rust
fn get_uid() -> u32 {
    let uid = fs::read_to_string("/proc/self/status").unwrap();
    let uid = uid.lines().find(|line| line.starts_with("Uid:")).unwrap();
    let uid = uid.split_whitespace().nth(1).unwrap();
    uid.parse::<u32>().unwrap()
}
```

It spits out `0` which is the UID of the root user and when I println! the file contents
of the `/proc/self/status` file, it shows the wrong UIDs.

```
Uid:    0    0    0    0
```

This was quite confusing to say the least.
However, after digging around a bit more and looking up at some forums, I found out that sudo
actually works by forking into a process to the root user and then running the program.
So the actual program that is reporting the UIDs is the sudo process and not the actual program.
Hence, the UIDs are wrong.

However, it turns out that when such a thing does happen, any type of escalation, be it from
`sudo` or `doas`, the `/proc/self/loginuid` file is set to the UID of the user who ran the program.

So I ended up using the following code to get the UID of the user who ran the program:

```rust
fn get_uid() -> u32 {
    let uid = fs::read_to_string("/proc/self/loginuid").unwrap();
    uid.parse::<u32>().unwrap()
}
```

As simple as that, I was able to get the UID of the user who ran the program.

I am testing it more, but it looks quite promising.
