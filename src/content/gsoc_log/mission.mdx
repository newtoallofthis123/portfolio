SWHKD is a key daemon, which is built on a dual server-client IPC model to ensure
security and usuability.
It is quite easy to setup on Linux systems and contrary to it's name, it works
quite well on both X11 and wayland.
I am working on coming up with a new security model that hopefully encapsulates
that server-client model into a _single daemon_ which would make it much more
accessible and user friendly.
