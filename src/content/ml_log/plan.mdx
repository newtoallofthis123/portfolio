Okay so the plan is going to be quite simple.

## Statquest

I am going to start my essentially watching statquests on Machine Learning.
My problem with Machine Learning is that I quit too early before I can actually get into the stuff that interests me and naturally
keeps me hookes enough to actuall learn stuff.
This used to happen a lot when I was learning to code, so to solve it, the solution was actually quite simple and I am sure most of you
might've already guessed it: I made it interesting.


Now there can be many ways that ML can be interesting to you, but for me personally, something is only interesting if I can build something 
cool with it. So eventually I will decide a project to build with it.
So till then, the video's will lay a very good foundation to make sure that I have a basic understanding of Machine Learning before I dive 
head first into so many topics.

To **reiterate** both for the user and myself, these statquest videos are only to get the brief concept of something.

## The Ml book

So I recently got my hands on the Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning book from MIT.
It is very good and it has been sitting in my to read list from a long time.
This book would give me good fundamentals that I would need to delve head first into this.

## Papers

Now that I have a good foundation of Machine learning, I would need a lot of papers. Over the course of my step 1 and step 2, hopefully
I have collected enough papers to make this viable.
If not, I would have to ask a guide for some good papers.


I only have this much planned for now, but yeah I am starting this and all of it is going to be documented well here.
