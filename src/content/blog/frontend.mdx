It has been a while since I've done like hardcore frontend web dev.
People many times seem to overlook how complex and important the frontend really is.
Now I know it has become like a very badly used cliche, of how someone is a "full stack web developer"
and "tech enthusiast", but there are a lot of front end devs that I really respect.
Also, most of them work at either vercel, supabase or some company in the
"Make web dev as simple as possible" space.

I do not think this is a coincidence.
These companies understand how truly important front end web development is to the user experience 
and how crucial it is to get it right.

Before I continue, it is important to mention that I am primarily a backend dev, I love working with
API's and stuff like that. So frontend is not really my cup of tea, but I think that makes my 2 cents on this all the more worth it. So let's get started :)

## Looks Do Matter
Buisnesses need attention: Attention of the consumer, attention of the general public, attention from investors.
However, we live in a world where our attention is more divided then ever. We are like dopamine addicts with the drug right in our pockets.
So if you are a medium to small size buisness, why would someone *stay*. Now this is what I think is the keyword here: _Stay_. Let me introduce to you the term marketing majors use for this: _Consumer Retention_.
To a business, this means everything. 
It is no
