It has been a while since I've done like hardcore frontend web dev.
People many times seem to overlook how complex and important the frontend really is.
Now I know it has become like a very badly used cliche, of how someone is a "full stack web developer"
and "tech enthuasist", but there are a lot of frontend devs that I really respect.
Also, most of them work at either vercel, supabase or some company in the
"Make web dev as simple as possible" space.

I do not think this is a coincidence.
These companies understand how truely important frontend web developement is to the user experince 
and how crucial it is to get it right.

Before I continue, it is important to mention that I am primarily a backend dev, I love working with
API's and stuff like that.
