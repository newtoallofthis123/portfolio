It's been about two months since I've made something significant or learnt something new on the personal side.
I have been learning and doing a lot of PHP for my [job](https://github.com/newtoallofthis123/Approach) and learning a lot about Linux processes for my [Gsoc]('/gsoc/logs') project,
but other than that, I've decided that I want to relax for a while.
That meant no blog posts, no youtube videos and minial social media presence.
So why come out of the bat cave now?

Well the last two months have been quite crucial for my health. I've been putting a lot of time in building a routine, going to the gym
regularly and doing other cool stuff, like playing Minecraft and watching a lot of movies on Netflix.
All of this, is obvious in my time other than the time that I am working. I work easily for about 6-8 hours a day, so whatever other time I
can carve, I have been putting it into this.

Although that doesn't mean that I have not done anything cool in code: I finally have a dev setup that I like and have muscle memory of.
After a lot of time putting off changing to a window manager, I finally switched from the default Gnome Desktop of my Ubuntu to i3.
I spent quite some time configuring my i3 to look exactly like I want it to, however, I found that sway was essentially i3 for wayland, I decided to switch to it.
It has been pretty awesome and not to mention looks awesome:
