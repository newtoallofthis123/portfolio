We have all been there:
If you know that I have an error at line 32 and you know that it is missing a `;`, why can't you add it for me!!!
Now if you use a really good text editor or a lsp server, you would probably never really run into this: the error would
be quite clear. However, imagine, what if, the compiler would actually fix the errors itself. I mean, to a certain extent at least.
So, let's into the intricacies of this. Grab a drink, I know I have :)
