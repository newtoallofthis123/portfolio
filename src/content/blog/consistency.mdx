It's been a while since I last published a blog post, primarily because I've been keeping myself
busy doing lots and lots of cool stuff over the past month.
I am writing this blog today, the end of June month, because: a) It's Sunday today and b) because I wanted
to express what a wonderful month June has been and what all I've accomplished.

Well I am proud to report that I finally have the schedule in place that I've oh so been trying to make since the past few months.
I wake up, go to college, come back, blog for a while, then go to the gym: which I've been trying to do for atleast 4 days a week.
It has been very helpful and I already feel a lot better. I feel active and overall just better.
I also get stuff done in regards to coding and my job.
My open source work for Summer of Code has also been going pretty well.

Well what I am trying to say is that I am finally consistent with my schedule and I am very happy about it.
So here's to consistency and to a better future. ðŸ¥‚ (It's apple juice)
