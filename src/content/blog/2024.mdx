2023 was a blast of a year. There were many ups and downs, mostly ups, but bird's view, it was fabulous.

2023 was filled with achievements. Some in public, some in my personal life, but yeah, man was this year huge for me. I began college, started actually working on my software journey...you know what, let me do it in bullets so I can feel proud

- Bought a new domain
- Started my site (the one you are now rn!)
- Started college
- Learnt languages other than python
- Typescript, Golang, Rust
- Became a rust fanboy
- Participated and cleared Hacktoberfest 
- Participated in my first hackathon and lost
- Decided to go the backend way ðŸ˜„
- Did 15 problems on Advent of Code

Man was I productive.

This year though is going to be bigger and better. I have a lot planned for this year. Here is one more list ( ordered on priority )

1. Gonna come up with a product idea
2. Gonna concentrate on my health, get some exercise done
3. Create a dev tool
4. Write a lot more
5. Go deeper on stuff I know
6. Partipate in GSOC

Doing all of this is not gonna be easy, but gotta do what I want to / gotta do ðŸ˜„

Anyways, Happy New year. Hope this year is cool for you as well.

PS: Quite proud of the fact that I am able to publish this from my mobile. Thanks Vercel.
