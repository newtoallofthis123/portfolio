Well yes you read that right.

I am retiring the domain noobscience(dot)rocks this year. Well to understand my thinking behind this move, you need to understand the brief history of my domain and how I got it in the first place.
Well, the TLDR is that I am a student and if you are still interested in reading, don't worry, I recently disabled copilot in Neovim so I am in no mood of writing long texts either.

So, if you are student, I am sure you are aware of GitHub Student Developer Pack, the awesome Education benefits that GitHub offers to students.
This includes a free domain for one year offered by the popular service provider Name(dot)com.
Let me make it completely clear, this is not a blog post dissing Name(dot)com. They are execllent at what they do. This has more to do with me and the boundaries that I set up for myself.

The domain as I had mentioned earlier, the domain was only free for an year and when I was booking it, I had forgotten to see the actual price of it.
Well let's just say that a small domain like noobscience(dot)rocks is not cheap *at all*.

So I guess that marks the end of that. 

It was always a dream of mine to show up in search results. I know **lame**, but hey, I did achieve that and I am quite grateful for that.

So, thanks `noobscience(dot)rocks`. I may replace you, but you'll always have a special place in my heart.
As the first domain I ever owned.
So here's to one and a lot more to come.
