A Website is a living thing. It's always changing, always evolving. And so is this one.
However, over the past 4 months, I've not really been able to work on this site.
I've been really contemplating what I want to do with this site, and I've finally come to a conclusion.

So, welcome to the new site! I've decided to move away from the old site, and start fresh.

## Why?

Well, for one, I am a digital hoarder and I like to keep everything I've ever made. This site was no exception. I had a lot of old posts, old and bulky 
code that was hard to maintain and really a lot of stuff that I didn't need. So, I decided to start fresh. I've also been learning a lot of new things, and I wanted to implement them in this site.
BTW, the site is still written in Astro.

With the amount of maintainance and work each blog post or project update needed, I was really unmotivated to write anything.
The whole point of my site was to write about my projects and stuff, which I love.

## What's New?

The site is now a lot more minimalistic. I've removed a lot of the clutter, and I've also removed the blog posts. I've decided to move to a more microblogging style of writing, and I'll be posting more often.
No more long posts, just short and sweet updates. I've also added a new section called "Projects", where I'll be posting about my projects.

All the old utilities like the [URL Shortener](https://nutils.vercel.app/go) and [Pastebin](https://nutils.vercel.app/code) are no longer on this site, but are instead hosted on a new Next.js site. It is still under heavy development, but you can check it out [here](https://nutils.vercel.app).

## What's Next?

Well get ready for a blast. This is a blazingly fast *almost static site* that makes it incredibly easy to write and publish posts.
So, easy access, easy writing, and easy publishing. I'm really excited to start writing again, and I hope to catch you in the next post!

## Thanks!

This site is really meant for people like you, who read my posts and use my utilities. So, thank you for being here, and I hope you enjoy the new site!
