PHP just feels like what my whole web development journey basically condenses down to.
I mean, it just works. I don't have to worry about anything. I just write some code and it works.

This is not how I usually like it. I use Languages like Rust and Go for most of my projects and now you are telling me 
that an integer is not an integer but a string? What the hell is that? But I don't know why I like it. It just feels right.
I mean, don't get me wrong. I am not like a "interpreter" guy. I like my code to be compiled and optimized. But PHP is just
a small little exception.

One of my favorite things about PHP is that it literally does what it says, it is a "Hypertext Preprocessor". It is not a
*programming language (although it is)*, it is a preprocessor. It is meant to be used with HTML. And that is what I like about it.

I just fits right into the whole dev process.

So, for example, let's say I want to use the `?id` query parameter to display a different message on the page. I can do that
with PHP like this:

```php
<?php
$id = $_GET['id'];

if ($id == 1) {
    echo "Hello World!";
} else {
    echo "Goodbye World!";
}
```

That's it. It just integrates so well at a server level. 

Anyways, that's it for my little rant. I am going to go back to my PHP project now. Bye!
